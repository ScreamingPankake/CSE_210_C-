And if Christ had not risen from the dead or have broken the bands of death that the grave should have no victory and that death should have no sting there could have been no resurrection But there is a resurrection therefore the grave hath no victory and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ He is the light and the life of the world yea a light that is endless that can never be darkened yea and also a life which is endless that there can be no more death
